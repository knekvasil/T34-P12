## T34 - Factors of success in abstract theoretical courses

Courses containing a lot of mathematics are traditionally hard for students. However, there are still some students who excel in them. The objective is to find out what these students do differently and whether there are activities or behavioural patterns that could be recommended to the other students to make such courses easier for them.
